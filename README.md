# rich-Sructured-News-Data
Google News structured data in PHP for any editorial content.

It generates the JSON from the database in PHP and includes the generated JSON and keeps it. 
To see it you have to do include.
Wherever include is with the directory, the generated JSON will be displayed. 
It can be hidden for users so that only Google can see it but you have to do that. 
Or that only Google can see the JSON through IP.

If your head is a separate file, you have to put include in the index.
Otherwise just reference the paths.
